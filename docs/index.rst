Welcome to annotate's documentation!
====================================

Annotate is an experiment in distributed database design
and an experiement in modern javscript techniques 
and a social experiment

Essentially - what if we could annotate a web page 
store the notes on any oAuth enabled system,
and simply see what other people within our social circles had wrtiten
on the page/

We guess someone else is already doing something like this, but thats
never stopped anyone from learning !
